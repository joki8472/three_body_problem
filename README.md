three_body_problem
==================

- python project to implement a quasi-analytic solution of the three-fermion Faddeev equations
  as presented in Few-Body Systems 22, 193â€“236 (1997) by Jensen et al.;

- eventually, the program should provide wave functions for the calculation of matrix elements
  of the weak interaction;
